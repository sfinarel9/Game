MEMORY GAME
 In this work the Memory Game is implemented. In this game the player chooses as the first step the level of difficulty he wants (Easy Board (3x4), Normal Board (4x5), Hard Board ( 6x6)), declares his/hers name and then start the game by pressing the 'Start' button. Can either read the instructions  or exit the game. Then  a new window will appear with 6 / 20 / 36 images depending on the level of difficulty chosen.
 The aim of the game is to turn all the cards, 2 per round and to identify the pairs that in the case of the easy level are 3 and in the next levels 10 and 18 respectively. For each pair the user finds, he earns points which are recorded at the bottom of the Frame.
 Then by starting the game the countdown begins. The  player is playing alternately with a second player . He keeps the score results in a file and the player with the highest score will be the winner. If none of the players match the cards and the countdoun ends , the game also ends without success. But if he succeeds a message of success will appear. During the game the player has the opportunity to restart or exit the game .
